## 7.0.0

This new major version contains breaking changes.

- Everything has been rewritten in TypeScript, which brings with it published type definitions
- The default export has been removed in favor of a named export; `import Scrollchor` must be replaced with `import { Scrollchor }`
- The `simulateClick()` API has been removed entirely
- Scrollchor is now a function component and makes use of hooks introduced in React v16.8, which necessitated a minimum version bump for this `peerDependency`
- `animation.easing` configuration is now documented and compatible with all the easing functions provided by [jquery-easing](https://github.com/danro/jquery-easing/blob/master/jquery.easing.js)
- Added two additional built-in easing types for _ease_ of use, borrowed from jQuery (`linear`, `swing`)
